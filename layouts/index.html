        Hi! Welcome to my small corner of the internet. I'm a half English, half
        Dutch DevOps engineer specialising in all things Amazon Web Services.
      </p>

      <p>
        I've built my career around cloud technologies; after starting out in a
        small AWS environment in a scale-up company 5 years ago, I've been
        fascinated in how I can continually improve my skills to improve my
        infrastructure. Learning doesn't stop when you leave the classroom, and
        I've had my chance to learn from the best around DevOps practises such
        as secure serverless architectures, containerisation, Infrastructure as
        Code (CloudFormation, Terraform and CDK) and the subtleties of every AWS
        service I've applied these principles to.
      </p>

      <p>
        These days I work for Oblivion Cloud Consultancy, part of the Xebia
        group. Here I'm surrounded by likeminded people, but I'm also challenged
        by my fellow consultants, pushing me to be on my A-game when it comes to
        designing the best solution. And once the architecture is locked in,
        it's all about working with teams to ensure they have the necessary
        knowledge to take that solution out of the diagrams and into reality.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I'm not running, travelling or being stuck behind a screen trying
        to keep up with the fast-moving landscape that is cloud computing, I
        like to share what I've learned with the world. Maybe you'll find me in
        front of you at a conference talk or training session someday, and if
        you would like to guarantee it, get in touch with me!
