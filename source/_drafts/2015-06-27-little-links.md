title: Little Links
---

There are so many little links to everything in life. Indeed, many religions show us how everything holds a connection, a sense of harmony. But that is not what I’m here to write about. These links are in a more tangible sense; people. There are brothers, sisters, friends, best friends, uncles, aunts… The list goes on. Boyfriends, girlfriends, fathers… mothers.

When you find that person you hold above all else, the one who keeps you strong, keeps you happy, their life becomes yours, as much as your life becomes theirs. You tell them everything, and they tell you everything. You give stories, and you receive them. And when a gaping hole gets ripped out of their life, it feels the same for you. It’s the link, and bond, you share.

So when Julie passed away, I didn’t know what to do. Suddenly, that’s it. The click of a finger. The flicker of a light. The curtains close, the light goes out. This scene is over, and it is time for the next scene in the whirling excitement we call life.

Every person holds a connection, and no matter how small it is, it is ever present. But I’m an outsider. She wasn’t my mother. I don’t know her. I never will. Yet in some respects I still hold a memory of who she is, how she was like. Through the many nights of stories, and tales, I built up my own image of her. I never portrayed her as perfect, like so many fairy tales. I never portrayed her as a role model, like so many pop stars or singers. What did I portray her as? Strong. Strong and always able to make the best of the situation that was put in front of her. From all that I’ve seen and heard, she has always had challenges to face, issues to deal with.

Still, through all that, she has given me someone who I cherish and love very dearly. For all she has done in her life, for that I cannot thank her enough. I was never able to show that gratitude in person, but that doesn’t mean I’ll forget it.
