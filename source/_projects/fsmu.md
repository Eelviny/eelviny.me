## Friends of St Michaels Uganda

### Ugandan charity
{:.subheader}

When I approached a charity and asked them to let me loose on their website, I'm surprised they said yes. But in an internet-centric world, even a charity needs to keep up with the times, and the result is their brand new website. Built on Foundation and run on Wordpress, this website allows for easy management by those less technically-minded, and is image-centric, right from the front page. I'm a member of the charity myself, you'll find the projects I run on this website too.
