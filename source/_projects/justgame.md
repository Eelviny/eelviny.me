## JustGame

### The first of many
{:.subheader}

Those were the days. The idea was to provide a set of simple game servers, focused simply on enhancing the game so as to make a massively multiplayer environment feasible. The first iteration, JustSurvival, focused on bringing this to Minecraft. JustGame focused on taking this idea and tying multiple indie games together into a massive community, 2000 members strong. Not all good things last forever - I started this business in 2013, then shut it down in 2015 to focus on education.
