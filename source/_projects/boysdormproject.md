## The Boys' Dorm Project

### Out into the world
{:.subheader}

This one was more of a team effort. A group of friends and I fundraised together to build a dormitory inside a Ugandan school. This was closely linked to my FSMU website work - it's the same charity! What made this different was that we built a boys dormitory in a girls school. While this may sound a buit counter-productive, we felt it was necessary; there are some boys at the school, if not many. This is because some are children of the teachers who also live within the school grounds, or orphans that overflowing orphanages can't provide for.
