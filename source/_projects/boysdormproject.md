## The Boys' Dorm Project

### Out into the world
{:.subheader}

This one's more of a team effort. Currently, a group of friends and I are fundraising together to build a dormitory inside a Ugandan school. This is closely linked to my FSMU website work - it's the same charity! What makes this different is that we're building a boys dormitory in a girls school. While this may sound a buit counter-productive, we feel it's necessary; there are some boys at the school, if not many. This is because some are children of the teachers who also live within the school grounds, or orphans that overflowing orphanages can't provide for.
