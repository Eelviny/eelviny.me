### Obsoleted but still alive
{:.subheader}

The website you're currently on is version 2, but that doesn't mean my first working version isn't still up for show! It uses a variety of different techniques compared to this site, with a very different aim - the site came about from the capabilities of Tumblr. At the time the convenience and price (free!) of Tumblr made it very easy to build a whole website from scratch, letting Tumblr do the heavy lifting in terms of content and serving the pages.
