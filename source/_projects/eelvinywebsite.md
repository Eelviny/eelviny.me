## Eelviny Website

### You're looking right at it
{:.subheader}

This website is a project in itself! This is my attempt to take the latest in web technologies and combine them to create the lightest, fastest website I can while still adapting perfectly for any screen size. This extends to what goes on under the hood as well; the website is entirely static and generated on my PC, so web hosting costs literally pennies per month. HTTPS is mandatory, and fully supported. What's more, the website is entirely open source, so if you decide to help my website for some reason, you can over on Github. It's more so you can use it as example, but you never know.
