## NXT-Python

### A new brain for an old toy
{:.subheader}

I've owned a Mindstorms NXT kit for a long time, and it surprised me how well it is has held up over the years. The limiting factor these days has to be the processing power of the brain of the unit, and this is where NXT-Python comes in. Using the communications protocol of the NXT brick, the computer becomes the 'brain' of the NXT, taking measurements from the sensors and relaying information back on how to move the motors. The bit in the middle is up to you - your limit is the power of your computer!
