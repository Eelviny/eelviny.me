### Static reconstruction
{:.subheader}

I've devised a plan to run the website for free, but in order to do so, a rewrite from the ground up is required. It's time to take a primarily static website off of Wordpress, and migrate it to Jekyll. GitHub Pages then builds and hosts the site, while Cloudflare makes it HTTPS-aware and gives it a speed boost. The same way this website is hosted!
