## Six Ideas Publication

### Keep it cost effective
{:.subheader}

My latest creation - Six Ideas approached me, looking a for a simple and cost effective way of displaying a publication on the internet. What's simpler than a static website and an external form API to collect people's details? This required a lot of back and forth to match the company's design specifications, but I'm happy with the result.
